<h3>Who Am I?</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Clark Sell, that you've gathered. I’m a very passionate, entrepreneurial person whose love for developing software was born from my obsessive passion for building and customizing automobiles. This love of creativity, this love of building, creating, lead me to software development. Like the automobile shrunk the world, the computer helped people scale. I love the Web. I love Mobile Apps. I love IoT and how it’s easier than ever to get a small micro controller to just do a thing. Technology is changing the world and I glad to be a small part of it.

      <h4>Founder and CEO</h4>
  		<p>That Conference is a not for profit company born out of the desire to further build a stronger development community here in the Midwest. That Conference is a volunteer organization of software developers across the Midwest who have been working together to partner with major industry leaders, speakers, and companies to create a three day experience where everyone can reinvest in themselves while creating a network of which they can leverage outside of the main conference.
