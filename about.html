<h3>Who Am I?</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Clark Sell but that you've gathered. I’m a very passionate, entrepreneurial person whose love for developing software was born from my passion for building and customizing automobiles. This this love of creativity and creation lead me to software development. Like the automobile shrunk the world, the computer helped us scale. I love how the Web, Mobile Apps, and devices and are connecting the world together, shrinking it, while advancing our society.
</p>

<p>
  I seek a career where I can work with a team of diverse, like-minded passionate people who strive to change the world with software. I seek a culture which strives for industry relevance, personal career growth, while achieving a family balance. I want to have fun while making a profit and teaching our craft to others.
</p>

<p>
  It's important to recognize ones successes while learning from their failures. Looking back I’d like to highlight a few of each:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Tangible and Xervo
  </li>
  <li>
    Driving and Leading Allstate Insurance to a software development practice founded on Agile, TDD, Continue Integration and Deployment. That work would later lead to creating an internal enterprise framework for the entire company which saved well over 20m dollars bootstrapping projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Jumpstart Kit. This was a product that Mark Nichols and I founded and created. The Jumpstart was a product that bolted onto TFS and would take the out of box product and add the necessary features to build, test and ship software the necessary server environments. It would later become a SKU’d product by Microsoft which is still maintained and sold to customers today.
  </li>
  <li>
    Achieving top honors at Microsoft. Microsoft is no doubt a large company and to be chosen to receive top honors was a great recognition from both Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer that the work I was driving was very valued by the company at large.
  </li>
  <li>
    That Conference started as an idea over lunch one day. How could we create something that rallied the larger software community in the Midwest and do so in a very big way? After two year of work our first conference kick off and was a very big success. 600 people and 250k later, we had done exactly that. We’re not done, that was just year 1.
  </li>
</ul>

  		<h2>That Conference</h2>
      <h4>Founder and CEO</h4>
  		<p>That Conference is a not for profit company born out of the desire to further build a stronger development community here in the Midwest. That Conference is a volunteer organization of software developers across the Midwest who have been working together to partner with major industry leaders, speakers, and companies to create a three day experience where everyone can reinvest in themselves while creating a network of which they can leverage outside of the main conference. But it doesn't stop there. We feel that teaching our craft to the younger generation is essential, especially at a young age. To that end, we focus on both the professional and the family. You can see more at That Conference.</p>
