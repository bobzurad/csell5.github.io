        I'm the cofounder and CEO of That Conference NFP. That Conference is a not for profit company born out of the desire to further build a stronger development community here in the Midwest. That Conference is a volunteer organization of software developers across the Midwest who have been working together to partner with major industry leaders, speakers, and companies to create a three day experience where everyone can reinvest in themselves while creating a network of which they can  leverage outside of the main conference. But it doesn't stop there. We feel that teaching our craft to the younger generation is essential, especially at a young age. To that end, we focus on both the professional and the family.
