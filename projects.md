### The Radon Controller

<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
During the normal summer months the radon mitigation system works as expected. In my house it lowers the radon levels from ~8.0 to ~0.6 depending on a few environmental factors such as rainfall. Durning the winter months especially when he temperature dips below freezing, it's not uncommon for the warm air being expelled to condensate and freeze the outside pipe solid. Once frozen the radon mitigation system is useless and the radon levels return to their original state.

My Solution? Use [Particle's Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit) to control your home's radon system based on external environmental data such as temperature.
