# Who Am I?

Hi my name is Clark, but I take it you’ve already gathered that. I’m a very passionate, entrepreneurial person whose love for developing software was born from my passion for building and customizing automobiles. This love, has lead me to a dedicated life of web and mobile software development. Just like the cars I’ve built, I love how the web and mobile applications are connecting the world together while advancing our society.

I seek a career where I can work with a team of diverse, like-minded passionate people who strive to change the world with software. I seek a culture which strives for industry relevance, personal career growth, while achieving a family balance. I want to have fun while making a profit and teaching our craft to others.

I’m currently a Program Manager and Developer Advocate for Microsoft. I live outside of Chicago and work with Microsoft's top commercial customers throughout the world. My goals are simple, help those partners build a world class product leveraging the Microsoft platform. For the past 15 years, I’ve built software for a number of fortune 100 companies. From a 5 man team to a 500 man team, I have been part of building a wide array of software solutions and applications. For the past three years I’ve dedicated my time to advancing our software community through evangelism and building open source software. I’m even the co-founder of a Not-For-Profit company who run a number of large technology based conferences, such as That Conference and HTML5.tx.

It's important to recognize ones successes while also learning from their failures. Looking back on my professional career I would like to highlight a few of the accomplishments of which I am most proud of.
